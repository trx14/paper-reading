## Objective
* In this work, the objective is to learn a prediction model from an EHR that take a set of disease conditions as input 
and gives a set of medications and their mappings to those disease conditions. This is a Multi-instance and Multi-label problem.

* difficulty: There have drug-drug/ drug-disease/ disease-disease interactions. And different mapping situations: one-one mapping
, many-one, many-many.
## Method
* (1) using a RNN based model to model label dependency, using an atteniton mechanism to map label-instance dependency.
* The model is shown below:
